# The Corruption Perception Index (CPI)
Welcome to the Corruption Perception Index (CPI) Prediction Project! In this project, we aim to predict the future Corruption Perceptions Index for countries by leveraging additional data from reputable sources like the World Bank and the United Nations (UN). The CPI is a crucial indicator that measures the perceived levels of public sector corruption in different countries, and our predictive models utilize a diverse set of features from WHO and UN datasets to enhance accuracy and comprehensiveness. By harnessing the power of machine learning, we strive to offer valuable insights into potential corruption trends and drive evidence-based decision-making for policymakers and organizations. Join us in this endeavor to foster transparency and accountability worldwide!
